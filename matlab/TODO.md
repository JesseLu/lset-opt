1.  Clean up the tests for the p update function
1.  Document the update function (new name?)
1.  Gram the island nucleation function

Next...
=======

1.  Figure out why the solver gives warnings about almost singular matrix.
1.  Work out theory on what the alternative solver actually does.
1.  Document (and make pretty) the alternative solver.
