Now...
======

1.  Figure out why the solver gives warnings about almost singular matrix.
1.  Core and document (and make pretty) the alternative solver.
1.  Write out theory for the alternative solver.
1.  Fix sign change error during regularization.
1.  Also, fix error where number of boundary points changes.
