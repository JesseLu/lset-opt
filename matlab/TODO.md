Now...
======

1.  Gram the island nucleation function

Next...
=======

1.  Figure out why the solver gives warnings about almost singular matrix.
1.  Work out theory on what the alternative solver actually does.
1.  Document (and make pretty) the alternative solver.
1.  Fix sign change error during regularization.
1.  Also, fix error where number of boundary points changes.
