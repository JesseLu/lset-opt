    Document lso_boundaries
    Change theory (maybe README as well) to reflect changes in implementation of initialize. Also make sure there is a section talking about what "regulatrization" means.

Next...
=======

    Make lso_plot function
    Make lso_fracfill function
    Add lso_fracfill check to lso_regularize
    Add lso_plot to lso_regularize example
